          <div class="ua">The bench press is a popular strength-training exercise that targets the muscles<br/>
            in the chest, shoulders, and triceps. It involves lying on a bench and pressing a <br/>
            barbell away from the chest until the arms are fully extended. <br/>
            The primary muscles worked during this exercise are the chest, shoulders <br/>
            and triceps. Variations include using a flat, incline, or decline bench. <br/>
            The bench press is commonly used to build upper body strength, improve <br/>
            pushing power, and enhance overall upper body aesthetics. <br/>
            It's important to use proper form, start with a manageable weight, and consider<br/> 
            safety measures such as having a spotter or using safety equipment.</div>
